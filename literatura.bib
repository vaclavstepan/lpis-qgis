  abstract = {Abstract             Understanding what variables affect ungulate neonate survival is imperative to successful conservation and management of the species. Predation is commonly cited as a cause‐specific source of mortality, and ecological covariates often influence neonate survival. However, variation in survival estimates related to capture methodology has been documented with opportunistically captured neonates generally displaying greater survival than those captured via aid of vaginal implant transmitters (VITs), likely because of increased left truncation observed in the opportunistically captured datasets. Our goal was to assess whether 3‐ and 6‐month survival estimates varied by capture method while simultaneously assessing whether capture method affected model selection and interpretation of ecological covariates for white‐tailed deer neonates captured from three study sites from 2014 to 2015 in North Dakota and South Dakota, USA. We found survival varied by capture method for 3‐month neonate survival with opportunistically captured neonates displaying up to 26\% greater survival than their counterparts captured via VITs; however, this relationship was not present for 6‐month survival. We also found model selection and subsequent interpretation of ecological covariates varied when analyzing datasets comprised of neonates captured via VITs, neonates captured opportunistically, and all neonates combined regardless of capture method. When interpreting results from our VIT‐only analysis for 3‐month survival, we found survival varied by three time intervals and was lowest in the first two weeks of life. Capture method did not affect 6‐month survival, which was most influenced by total precipitation occurring during 3 – 8~weeks of a neonate's life and percent canopy cover found at a neonate's capture site. Our results support previous research that capture method must be accounted for when deriving survival estimates for ungulate neonates as it can impact derived estimates and subsequent interpretation of results.},

  abstract = {In agricultural landscape, there are thousands of young wild animals killed every year. Their deaths are caused mostly by agricultural fieldworks during spring harvest. Among the affected animals there are also fawns of roe deer (               Capreolus capreolus               ), which react to danger by pressing themselves against the ground in order to be protected from predators. There were various methods tested in the past aimed at decreasing roe deer mortality caused by agriculture machinery with varied levels of success. This contribution presents technology that documents the possibility of searching for fawns with a thermal imaging device carried by an unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The results are based on field research that estimated the ideal height of flight being ±40 meters above ground. If the climatic conditions are favourable, it is possible to monitor and mark fawn locations using GPS coordinates in an area of about 14 ha in 25 minutes, which is the average flight time of UAV on one battery charge. The thermo-camera is very reliable in finding fawns in early morning hours (4 to 6 a.m.) when there is the highest temperature contrast between the searched object and its surroundings. The main limiting factors are climatic conditions and the short time span in which the thermo-camera can be used. If the basic requirements are met, the rate of successful fawn detection can be even up to 100\%. An undisputed advantage of this method is the possibility of involvement of local gamekeepers. Thus the agricultural fieldworks are not interrupted.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            In the agricultural landscape, thousands of animals are killed yearly as a result of agricultural machinery innovation, mostly because of a higher harvesting speed and wider cutting bars. Harvesting machines besides predation by red fox (               Vulpes vulpes               L.) on roe deer (               Capreolus capreolus               L.) in the intensively managed cultural landscape are the most crucial factor in fawn mortality. This article offers an evaluation of the mostly used preventive methods, which aim to drive roe deer does along with their fawns out of fodder meadows prepared for harvest in the Czech Republic. Evaluation of efficiency and effectiveness of the different methods was made based on the questionnaire survey published in a professional hunting journal. The assessment of responses from a survey was followed by a field-based investigation conducted before fodder harvesting. The devices studied for efficiency were acoustic, optical and scent deterrents in comparison to the traditional search method combined with volunteers and hunting dogs. The results show differences in the number of fawns saved per hectare. A significant difference was found only between the optical deterrent method (0.4 fawns saved per hectare) and traditional search method (0.09 fawns saved per hectare). This study found no substantial difference among various deterring devices in terms of their effectiveness in reducing the mortality of roe deer fawns. Thus, it is important to explore the innovative methods in the future that can work most effectively for saving not only deer fawns, but also other game animals in the cultural landscape.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a UAV based remote sensing system for the detection of fawns in the meadows. There is a high demand because during pasture mowing many wild animals, especially roe deer fawns are killed by mowing machines. The system was tested in several real situations especially with differing weather and iluminating conditions. Its primary sensor is a lightweight thermal infrared camera. The images are captured onboard of the flight system and also transmitted as analog video stream to the ground station, where the user can follow the camera live stream on a monitor for manual animal detection. Beside a high detection rate a fast workflow is another very important objective for this application. Therefore a waypoint planning software was developed that accelerates the workflow. At adequate illuminating and weather conditions the presented UAV-based fawn detection via thermal imaging is a comfortable, fast and reliable method.},
